Hey there!

Im making this little RPG game in discord.

You are free to use this to make your own with custom biomes, dialouges, places and simple quests (you can currently set quests so the user has to kill an enemy X number of times.). This is still work in progress and i am planning to add a lot more!

Install guide is in the README.md file.

:D
